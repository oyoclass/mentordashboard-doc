In this section we'll break down how to read the challenge checking interface
in the **Check Solutions** tab.

## Choosing a Challenge
You can choose which challenge you want to begin checking solutions for by
clicking on any of the challenge names listed in the left panel, after which
it will be colored blue with a small marker on the left of its name.

After selecting a challenge from the left panel, the image on the right side
will be replaced with the solution checking interface:

![Full Challenge Checking Interface](/img/check/challenge_checking_interface_full.png){:.center}

## The Challenge Section
The topmost section of the interface includes the name of the challenge, as
well as the description of the challenge as it appears in the community the
currently viewed solution is submitted to. In the following example, the
challenge's name is **Challenge 1**:

## The Solution Section
The section below the challenge section is the solution section, which lists
the student's alias, which community it was submitted in at which
time, along with an estimated grade level of the submitter:

#### Viewing the Solution Key
If the challenge has one available, then the **View Solution Key** button will
open a panel containing the solution key as configured by the original
challenge creator as well as any attachments that were included in the
challenge's creation:

#### Skipping Solutions
The final thing of note in this section is the **Skip to Next Solution**
button. If there is a particular submission that is problematic or not easily
checked, you may click on the skip button to leave the current solution
unchecked and load the next one in the queue instead (after a short delay to
prevent abuse).  
When the skip button is pressed, **the solution you were viewing will**
**automatically be freed for other mentors to check.**

## The Check Section
In this section, this is where you may mark your assessment of the submission
and determine whether the student passed the challenge or not:

![The Check Section](/img/check/challenge_checking_interface_check_section.png){:.center}

The dropdown on top chooses the action (pass or fail the solution), if you are
passing the solution, then the **badge issue notes** section will be visible.
Below this is where you may leave feedback to the student. Finally below the
feedback section, is the button you click to submit your judgement (and
automatically load the next checkable solution to the challenge if one exists).

#### "Copy Link from Solution" Badge Issue Notes Shortcut
For many challenges, the solution is simply a link to a project on an app.
These types of solutions may easily be put into the badge notes by simply
clicking on the **Copy link from solution** button in the **Badge Issue Notes**
section.

#### Reusing Recent Feedback
Very often, especially for passing solutions, not much more feedback is needed
than a "Great!" or a "Good job". Also for solution fails, there likewise is
common stumbling points and mentors will often need to fail solutions for the
same reason many times.

To address this, included in the checking interface is the
**Pick feedback from recent history** button found directly above the feedback
input window. When you click on it, depending on if you have chosen to pass or
fail the current solution, a window with your most recent feedbacks will be
listed. You may click on one of them to quickly fill in the feedback
field for rapid solution checking.

**Pass:**

**Fail:**
![Recent Fail Feedback](/img/check/challenge_checking_interface_check_section_feedback_history_fail.png){:.center}

#### Stop Checking a Challenge
If you want to stop checking any challenge solution for any reason without
continuing to the next one, you should click on the **Take out of Review**
button found near the top right of the solution:

![Recent Fail Feedback](/img/check/challenge_checking_interface_check_section_take_out.png){:.center}

Clicking this button **will free the currently viewed solution for other**
**mentors to check.** If you forget to click this button when exiting the
dashboard, it will take several hours for the solution to automatically be
freed, so forgetting to do this may result in some feedback being delayed.
