## Page Layout
When you either first enter your community's dashboard or click on the
**Check Solutions** tab, you will be brought to a page that looks similar to
this:

![Check Solutions Landing Page](/img/check/landing.png)

On the left hand side is the list containing all challenges with unchecked
solutions that you are personally eligible to check within your community
group. This list includes all challenges with solutions **that you are**
**eligible to check.** This means that **every individual mentor in your**
**community group may have a slightly different view depending on which**
**communities each mentor has permissions in**.
